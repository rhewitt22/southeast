The Tennessee Field Office provides assistance to Federal and State agencies, local governments, businesses, and the general public relative to conserving, protecting, and restoring habitat for migratory birds and federally threatened and endangered species. Our assistance is typically provided through six programs:

 - pre-development consultation
 - federal permits and projects
 - endangered species
 - environmental contaminants
 - partners for fish and wildlife
 - and education/outreach.
